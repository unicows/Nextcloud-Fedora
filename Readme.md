# Nextcloud Installer for Fedora

---

Simple bash script to automate Nextcloud installation on Fedora. Useful if Docker and snap are too restrictive for you.

### Caveats:

- Supported versions
  - Fedora 29, Nextcloud 15
- Manual editing of the script needed to change data folder
- No automated LetsEncrypt
